## Overview

Majik Message replaces traditional username and password accounts with **cryptographic identity**. Messages are encrypted end-to-end using Ed25519 and X25519 elliptic curve cryptography, ensuring only recipients with the correct private keys can decrypt them.

Whether online or offline, you maintain full control over your encrypted communications—without relying on centralized infrastructure, personal information, or trusted intermediaries.

### What Makes Majik Message Different

- **True End-to-End Encryption**: Military-grade encryption using Ed25519 and X25519
- **Seed Phrase Identity**: No email or phone number required—your 12-word seed phrase is your account
- **Works Offline**: Encrypt and decrypt messages without internet connection
- **No Permanent Storage**: Messages automatically expire and are never permanently stored on servers
- **Multi-Platform**: Desktop app, web app, and Chrome extension


## Key Features

### End-to-End Encryption

Majik Message uses proven elliptic curve cryptography:

- **Ed25519**: Generates and manages your cryptographic identity
- **X25519 (Curve25519)**: Handles secure key exchange and message encryption
- **AES-256-GCM**: Encrypts message content with authenticated encryption

Every message is encrypted on your device before transmission and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient. Not even Majik Message servers can access your message content.

### Seed Phrase–Based Identity

Your account is a 12-word BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase—the same standard used by cryptocurrency wallets:

- Each seed phrase deterministically generates an Ed25519 keypair
- Your public key serves as your account identity and fingerprint
- Your private key never leaves your device and is never transmitted
- No email, phone number, or personal information required

As long as you have your 12 words, you can recover full access to your identity and decrypt your messages—anywhere, anytime.

### Offline Operation

Majik Message doesn't require constant connectivity:

- **Encrypt messages offline**: Generate encrypted messages without internet access
- **Decrypt messages offline**: Read previously received messages anytime
- **Verify identities independently**: Confirm contact fingerprints using cryptographic verification

This makes Majik Message ideal for high-security environments, air-gapped systems, or situations where network access is restricted.

### Realtime Messaging (Free for Everyone)

When online, Majik Message provides instant encrypted messaging:

- WebSocket-based realtime delivery
- Messages stored temporarily in Redis with automatic expiration (24 hours default, expandable to 30 days)
- Typing indicators and read receipts for active conversations
- Messages automatically expire and are permanently deleted from servers

### Group Messaging

Secure group conversations with up to 25 participants:

- Each message is individually encrypted for every group member
- Same security guarantees as one-on-one messaging
- Typing indicators and read receipts work in group chats

### Message Expiration Timer

Set custom expiration times for sensitive conversations. Messages automatically delete after the specified duration, reducing your digital footprint.

### Encrypted Message Export

Messages can be exported as encrypted Base64 strings:

- Download and archive encrypted messages locally
- Share encrypted content through any channel (email, file storage, etc.)
- Messages remain fully encrypted outside the platform

### Solo Messages for Personal Storage

Encrypt messages where you are the only recipient—perfect for private notes and journals:

- Sender-only encryption for personal storage and archival
- Works entirely offline in local mode (Message tab)
- Perfect for encrypted journals, notes, passwords, or sensitive information
- Export as encrypted Base64 strings for backup or transfer

### Multi-Account Support

Manage multiple cryptographic identities for different contexts:

| Account Type | Local Storage     | Online Registration |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Free Users   | Up to 25 accounts | 5 accounts          |
| Paid Users   | Up to 25 accounts | 10 accounts         |

**What this means:**
- **Local accounts** can encrypt and decrypt messages offline but cannot send/receive realtime messages
- **Registered accounts** have full access to realtime messaging, typing indicators, and online features
- You can swap which accounts are registered online at any time

### Chrome Extension

Available on the Google Chrome Web Store:

- Browser-based encryption and decryption
- DOM scanning: Automatically detect encrypted messages on any webpage and decrypt them inline
- Offline-only operation: Designed for local encryption/decryption workflows

## How It Works

### Account Creation

When you create a Majik Message account:

1. A 12-word BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase is generated using cryptographically secure random number generation
2. The seed phrase deterministically generates an Ed25519 keypair
3. The Ed25519 keys are converted to X25519 (Curve25519) keys for encryption
4. Your public key is hashed (SHA-256) to create your account fingerprint
5. Your private key is encrypted with a passphrase (PBKDF2-SHA256, 250k iterations) and stored locally in IndexedDB

**Critical security note:** Your seed phrase and private key never leave your device. The passphrase you set protects your encrypted private key in local storage.

### Sending an Encrypted Message

#### For Solo Messages (sender-only):

1. An ephemeral X25519 keypair is generated for this message only
2. A shared secret is computed using your ephemeral private key and your own public key (ECDH)
3. The shared secret is hashed (SHA-256) to derive a 256-bit AES key
4. Your message is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using the derived key and a random 12-byte IV
5. The encrypted message, IV, and ephemeral public key are packaged and stored locally

#### For Group Messages (2+ recipients):

1. A random 256-bit AES key is generated for the message
2. The message is encrypted once with AES-256-GCM
3. An ephemeral X25519 keypair is generated
4. The AES key is individually encrypted for each recipient using X25519 shared secrets

This ensures only authorized recipients can decrypt the message, and the ephemeral key prevents long-term compromise.

### Receiving and Decrypting a Message

1. Your device retrieves the encrypted payload from the server or extracts it from the DOM (browser extension)
2. The message fingerprint identifies which of your accounts should decrypt it
3. Your private key is unlocked by decrypting it with your passphrase
4. A shared secret is computed using your private key and the sender's ephemeral public key
5. The AES key is derived from the shared secret (SHA-256)
6. The message is decrypted using AES-256-GCM with the derived key and the provided IV

If decryption fails (due to tampering or incorrect keys), an authentication error is thrown and the message is rejected.

## Security

### What Majik Message Protects

- **Message content**: End-to-end encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Identity privacy**: No phone numbers or email addresses required
- **Private keys**: Never transmitted; encrypted at rest with PBKDF2-derived passphrase
- **Forward secrecy**: Ephemeral keys ensure past messages remain secure even if current keys are compromised

### What Users Must Protect

- **Your 12-word seed phrase**: This is the ONLY way to recover your account. If lost, your account and messages are permanently inaccessible. Store it securely offline.
- **Your passphrase**: Protects your locally stored private key. Choose a strong, unique passphrase.
- **Device security**: If your device is compromised while your account is unlocked, an attacker could access your private keys.

### What Majik Message Does Not Protect

- **Metadata**: Timing, message frequency, and participant relationships may be visible to servers or network observers
- **IP addresses**: Your IP address is visible to Majik Message servers when you connect for realtime messaging
- **Device compromise**: If malware or an attacker gains access to your unlocked device, they may access decrypted messages or private keys

---

## Roadmap

Majik Message is under active development. Planned features include:

- **File and image sharing** (Coming soon): Send encrypted files and images directly through Majik Message
- **Voice messages** (Coming soon): Encrypted audio recording and playback
